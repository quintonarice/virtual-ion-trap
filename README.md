# Virtual Trapped-Ion System Prototype

This repository contains a browser-based interactive prototype
demonstrating key physical principles of a linear Paul trap.

Features:
- a–q Mathieu stability diagram
- Real-time parameter sliders (RF voltage, ion mass)
- Live stability feedback

Purpose:
This prototype is intended as a proof-of-concept for an interactive
virtual trapped-ion laboratory experience for instructional use.

No backend or external dependencies are required.
